                    <p>I often wonder what our generation will be known for in the decades to come? There are so many great things we could be remembered for- the developed economies, better jobs, the bullet trains, the SpaceX mission to Mars, freedom of opinion and speech like never before, the new found equality, and what not! But my greatest worry is that our generation might be looked at as the one that gave up on love, the one that never had a good understanding of the idea of love, just a very poor interpretation of it, the first one that moved away from the conventional takes on romantic, loving relationships.
</p>
                    <p>The most common characteristic that stands out amongst us Generation-Yers is our need for instant gratification. We were brought up and continue to thrive in a world that allows us instant access to just about anything. If we are craving say, a chocolate lava cake, we have it delivered with the click of a few buttons instead of walking a block or two and grabbing it from the nearest eatery. If we are getting bored, we have endless distractions in the form of mobile apps. If we need directions to the supermarket or a simple cheese sandwich recipe, it only takes us a couple of seconds. Such a convenience is entirely a modern-day perk that the previous generations never experienced even remotely. But the problem with instant gratification is that it’s addicting and often takes the form of a habit, a habit that tends to seep into our love lives without us even realising it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Dating has now become a sport- a favorite pastime amongst us. We commit ourselves to relationships that are not based on love that binds or attracts, but, are based on safety, advantage and comfort zones. We are only seeking relationships of convenience these days. Well, of course, it's the easy way out. The logic makes absolute sense until the point the relationship needs for us to compromise, which is very often, and then we're left in a dilemma, which is fine, as long as we accept that the compromises need to be made. But we don’t. We instead are of the view that love, any kind of love, is replaceable.
</p>

                    <p>We are living in a world where we trick the people as well as ourselves into believing that the love we are getting is all the love we are worth, that it is all that is available to us and that we should be grateful for whatever little we got. We just want the envelope of safety for ourselves, want to be the ones with the advantage in a relationship. We're too used to being pampered and taken care of to step up and do it for ourselves or someone else. We're so used to having everything under control—our finances, our lifestyles, our relationships, that we don't want to be challenged anymore. None of us want to be at the edge of the cliff because we fear the fall. We'd rather just be rooted wherever we are and let the chosen idea of love run stale and dry till the point we decide to move on to the next one. We're okay with being in a relationship where loving is a choice. Since when is loving a choice in a loving relationship?! And then, we complain that the idea of love is flawed, illusive and non-existent altogether. We blame love for our lack of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>Yes, love is confusing. It has its layers and is mutable. It changes over time and changes with each new person we let into our lives. But that’s the beauty of it, something we conveniently decide to overlook. Of course, each individual is different in his or her understanding, but most of us are incredibly lost. The issue is that if we don't come to understand love better — its purpose, its significance, its limitations and its shortcomings — we'll probably be remembered not as the generation to accept a more logical and rational take on love as most of us would like to think, but as the one that gave up on it altogether.

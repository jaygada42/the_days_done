                    <p>Writing and the ability to read it are the markers of civilization.  Great stories can have great lives in the oral tradition too but we privilege reading and writing simply because it allows us to interact directly and transparently with the people who live very far away from us. It allows us to hear the thoughts and opinions of the people who are long dead. Stories are about communication. Grammar wasn’t invented by the human race so that your lives would be miserable in school as you attempted to learn what the hell prepositions are, grammar was invented because without prepositions we couldn’t possibly describe what it’s like to fly “through” the cloud or jump “over” a puddle or lie down “beneath” the star-studded sky with utmost precision. Like right now, if I am doing my job and you are doing yours, you aren’t thinking about the fact that I am writing random alphabets that exist as ideas in your brain, it’s just happening on its own. But if my language gets confusing, if I “don tgiveri ghtpause sattheri ghtplaces”, or if “I incorrect word order use”, or “I écrire en Francais”, I create a barrier between you and myself. Writing, at least good writing, is an emergence of that impulse to use language to communicate complex ideas and experiences to people. Reading is always an act of empathy, and it’s true whether you are reading Jane Austen or bad vampire fiction. It’s always an imagination of what it’s like to be someone other than yourself. So when Salinger used a red hunting cap or when Shakespeare used iambic pentameter, they weren’t doing this so that your English teachers could have something to torture you with. They were doing this so that the story could have a bigger and better form in your mind.
</p>
                    <p>Here’s the thing : It is extremely difficult to get other people to feel what you are feeling. Like, you may have experienced it in your own life. Say my college boyfriend broke up with me...and he did. And I want to explain what I am feeling to my best friend. So I say, I am “completely obliterated” and my “heart is broken”. In fact, my heart is shattered into a million pieces. A few things are going on here: first, in my excellent news, my heart has not been shattered into a million pieces. It is still pumping blood in precisely the same way that it did before the break up. Secondly, in further good news, I am not totally obliterated. My total obliteration would look something like this:
</p>
                    <p>I am using a metaphor, in the case of my broken heart, and the techniques of hyperbole, in the case of obliteration, to try to describe the things that are happening to me. But because I am not using original or particularly compelling figurative language, my friend may struggle to empathise with me. Now imagine that you are supposed to communicate far more complicated and detailed emotions. And instead of just communicating them to your best friend or family, you are trying to talk to strangers, some of whom may live in another part of the world and, in fact, live centuries after you are dead. Not just that, but instead of this happening during a pleasant casual conversation, these strangers are reading your dry, dead text on a page. They cannot hear your intonation or see the tears dripping from your cheeks . That is the challenge Shakespeare faced, and it’s also the challenge that you face when you are writing for an audience, whether you write a novel or simply a Facebook comment on your friend’s post
</p>
                    <p>I am not asking you to go symbol-hunting between the pages of a book because reading is supposed to be some treasure map in which you discover symbols, write them down, and then get an A in the class. I am asking you to read critically because by understanding language, you will a) have a full understanding of lives, other than your own, which b) will help you to be more empathetic and understanding towards others, and most importantly, c) reading critically and attentively can give you the linguistic tools you need to share your own story with more precision. Yes, this will help people to understand your joy and your heartbreaks, but it will also be helpful in many other ways, like when you are trying to convince the company to go ahead with your fourth quarter strategy or whatever it is that people with real jobs do. So if I’ve convinced you to at least pick up a book and give it an honest try, my job is done. Happy reading!
